### Question Pair Matching
Questions are composed of semantic, syntactic and grammatical features. The relative importance of different features will depend on the topic in which the question belongs. In order to leverage these properties to match question pairs, 3 models were combined with final boosted decision tree. The first model is a topic model. In order to model each questions topic, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used. A strict topic match between question 1 and question 2 was not enforced. Instead, predicted topics were passed to the final decision tree. This allows for the possibility of a duplicate question spanning multiple topics. The second model is an end-to-end classification based on each questions TF-IDF vectors. Lastly, for some topics a strict matching between proper names is important. For example, in the travel topic, when asking directions to specific places, its is important to match the specific place name. In order to capture this information, Named Entity Recognition (NER) is used. The level of matching between NER objects in q1 and q2 is then passed as a feature into the final decision tree to allow different levels of NER matching for different question topics.
